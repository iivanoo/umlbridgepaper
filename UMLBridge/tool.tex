\section{Implementation of the bridge}\label{sec:tool}
We implemented the proposed bridge in the context of the Eclipse platform.
More specifically, it is realized as an Eclipse plugin that can be used in two different ways:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item as a standard Eclipse plugin; this allows designers to integrate the bridge
with other technologies available in the Eclipse community (e.g., model differencing tools, model transformation engines, and so on) 
	\item as a stand-alone application in which the bridge and its dependencies are packed together. This allows designers
	to use the bridge also outside the Eclipse environment.
\end{enumerate}
%
Figure \ref{fig:tech} shows the modeling technologies we used to realize it; for the sake of simplicity
transformations from MOF to UML are not represented in figure.
Models and metamodels are represented by means of the EMF 
framework\footnote{EMF project website: \small{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/}}}.
It includes an implementation of the MOF meta-metamodel called Ecore, and runtime support for models including,
among all, persistence support by serializing models in the OMG XML Metadata Interchange (XMI).
UML profiles are defined using UML2,
the implementation of the UML metamodel for the Eclipse
platform\footnote{UML2 project Web site:
\underline{http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/}.}. 
This provides the bridge full compliance with OMG standards
(specifically UML 2.0 and MDA) and interoperability with other
UML modeling tools\footnote{List of UML2-compatible UML Tools: \small{\url{http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2-Tool-Compatibility}}}. This allows designers to graphically design UML
profiles with any UML modeling tool and directly import them into
the Eclipse environment. The same rationale holds for UML models.

Both model transformations and annotation models are based on the Atlas Model Management Architecture (AMMA)~\cite{1}.
More specifically, all model transformations in the bridge are specified using the
Atlas Transformation Language (ATL)~\cite{3}, an hybrid model
transformation language with both declarative and imperative constructs (Listing \ref{lst:generatedTransf} shows an excerpt of ATL code).
The technology used for representing and manipulating annotation models is the Atlas Model
Weaver (AMW)~\cite{3}. It allows the (graphical) definition of correspondences
among models and links among model elements. Such
links are captured by weaving models conforming to an extensible weaving metamodel \cite{MCDFthesis}.  
We chose the AMMA platform since it best fits to
the requirements we had to implement the bridge: (i) it provides a flexible model transformation engine, 
(ii) it supports the concept of transformation model, thus enabling the development of higher-order transformations,
and (iii) it is integrated into Eclipse and its modeling facilities~\cite{bezivin_06_canonical}.
