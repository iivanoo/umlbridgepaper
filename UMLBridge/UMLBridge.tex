\begin{abstract}
In Model Driven Engineering, UML profiles and MOF-based Domain Specific Modeling Languages are the most used approaches for describing domain specific applications.  
The choice of the right approach depends on several aspects, such as tool support, expressivity, complexity of models, company policies. In general, profiled UML models are very much used since they are intuitive for designers and model editors already exist, however they are intrinsically complex for model manipulation (e.g., transformation, analysis) is complex; conversely, DSML models are more concise and easy to be manipulated, but they require an initial effort in terms of designers training and model editors development. 
%What happens today is that UML is widely used by designers, but the underlying tools suffer from the complexity of the models. 

In this paper we propose an approach that allows to get the best of the two worlds: 
on one side designers describe the system using a UML profile familiar to them, on the other side DSML models (automatically generated from profiled UML models) enable a better model manipulation. Our approach is based on an automatic bridge between UML profiles and MOF metamodels (which are the main artifacts of MOF-based DSMLs). The bridge is transparent to the user since it autonomously operates both on UML profiles 
%(and their associated MOF metamodels) 
and all the involved models. The bridge is realized through model transformation techniques in the Eclipse platform. In this paper we show its application on a case study based on SysML.


%In Model Driven Engineering, the use of UML profiles and Domain Specific Modeling Languages are the most used approaches for specifying and documenting a system. The choice of the right approach depends on several aspects, such as tool support, expressivity, complexity of models, company or organization policies. What happens today is that in many UML-based approaches, models are intrinsically complex and the application of a profile on them exarcebates this situation; this complexity affects also the other artifacts (e.g., model transformations, graphi) associated to the
%
%
 %profiling and the use of a DSML are mutually exclusive. This precludes the possibility to benefit from both techniques while design the system of interest.
%This paper presents an approach for bridging UML profiles and MOF metamodels with a focus on automation. Indeed, the proposed mechanism is fully automatic and operates at both metamodelling and modelling levels. The approach is realized through model transformation techniques in the Eclipse platform.
